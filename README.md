###  About Me

I'm exploring the intersection of **LLMs**, **HPC I/O optimization**, and **systems research**. My current focus is on building **trustworthy diagnostics** for I/O logs using **retrieval-augmented LLMs**, and applying **multimodal learning** for **intent discovery** in livestreams. I enjoy debugging hard problems, both in code and compute.

- **Domain-Specialized RAG Systems**  
  Built a pipeline to analyze Darshan logs using RAG + code generation + context retrieval (CSV+summary) → dynamic LLM diagnostics for I/O inefficiencies.

-  **Custom Architectures for CIFAR**  
  Training DiT-style networks **without convs or transformers**, achieving >95% accuracy using **sliding window attention + class conditioning**.

-  **Research Implementation: NAACL '22**  
  Implementing **Multimodal Intent Discovery** using joint embeddings + clustering on livestream transcripts and visual frames.

-  **Blockchain-Backed Platforms**  
  Built a crowdsourced reporting tool with **Django + React + Ethereum**, integrating smart contracts and decentralized trust.
